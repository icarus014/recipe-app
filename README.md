# Inspiration
The inspiration for the creation of this app came from my love for cooking, which has been apart of my life for many years, and i don't ever see this passion going away any time soon. I see cooking as a way of relieving stress, especially when you are making something new. I look for different recipes to make almost every week, I now have a place to store them, as well as any other user who decides to utilize this web application. 

# Technologies
The technologies used to create this app include, React.js, axios, Mongo Atlas, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, Bcrypt, React Cookies, JWT, and Cors.


# Current Bugs / Unfinished Functionality 
There is one bug included in this application, which is the save button feature, which would allow the user to save any recipe that they might have created. When clicking the save button on the recipe, the app crashes completely. 

# Future functionality
Some feature that will be coming soon, will include editing and deleting any created recipes by the user
